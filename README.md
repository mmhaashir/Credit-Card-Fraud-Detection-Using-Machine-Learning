Credit card fraud detection is a proactive security measure employed by financial institutions to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions. Leveraging sophisticated techniques from the field of machine learning, this process involves analyzing vast amounts of transactional data in real-time to detect anomalies and patterns that deviate from typical spending behavior. By building and training predictive models, financial institutions can swiftly recognize unusual activities, such as unusually large purchases, transactions from unfamiliar locations, or unusual spending patterns. These models continuously learn and adapt, refining their ability to accurately differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, thereby providing a robust defense against fraudulent activities and ensuring the protection of customers' financial assets and sensitive information.

Fraud detection is achieved in this project by the following three methods:
-  Logistic Regression
-  Random Forest
-  Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network)

The following outputs were obtained for each of the above methods:

- Precision
- Recall
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
